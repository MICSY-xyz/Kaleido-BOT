# ‚ö†Ô∏è Essential Security Rules #

To ensure optimal performance and prevent account restrictions, please adhere to the following guidelines:

Account & Device Restrictions: A maximum of 2 accounts per device and 5 accounts per IP subnet (including Hotspots) are allowed. Exceeding these limits can result in temporary or permanent bans.

VPN/Proxy Limitations: Using VPNs or proxies can lead to detection and account suspension. Always connect through a genuine, unaltered network.

Anti-Bot Measures: The bot mimics human-like behavior to avoid detection. Refrain from making frequent mining requests within a short timeframe.

Request Frequency: Mining attempts are limited to 5 per hour per account. Exceeding this limit may trigger temporary cooldowns or account restrictions.
